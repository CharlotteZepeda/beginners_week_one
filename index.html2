I am currently learning to code with <a href="https://www.codefirstgirls.org.uk">Code First Girls</a>. Going over everything from how the
internet works, to creating websites and version control with git. A lot to cover in only 8 weeks!
<p>Everyone should learn to code, here are some pretty good reasons why...</p>

<ol>
  <li>You learn what is going on 'under the hood'
<li>Not have to rely on someone for a quick prototype website!
<li>It's fun!</li>
</ol>


<h2>What do you need to create a website?</h2>

<p>Not much!</p>
<ul>
<li>A computer (always a good start)
<li>A text editor (I am using atom)
<li>A web browser (I am using chrome)
<li>Some HTML, CSS and JS files</li>


<p>Follow my progress on <a href="https://github.com">github</a></p>
